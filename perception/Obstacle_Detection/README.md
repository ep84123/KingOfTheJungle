# Obstacle Detection Module
##Main Idea:
detect objects & track them, in order to recognize significant change in object's dimensions - which testifying on "treat".

###Current Tasks:
1. Implement great Detector - Ronel
2. Build skeleton of tracker with size changes recognizer - Tal
3. Implement full cycle of objects detection and threats warning - Tal & Ronel
4. Improve runtime

###Nice To Have & Farther Ideas:
1. Tools for video processing (will be usefully in testing)
2. Merge some bboxes to keep track (id) also in big changes
3. Cooperate with the other module, in order to improve runtime.
